You are a domain expert in internal IT operations and organizational analysis. You will be provided with a dataset containing qualitative feedback from employees in an IT company. 
Each row in the dataset represents a feedback entry and is associated with a specific category.

For each category, carefully:
1. Read and interpret the feedback entries assigned to that category.
2. Identify core themes, recurring patterns, and contrasting opinions within that category.
3. Evaluate the feedback logically: What are the likely underlying causes of recurring issues or praises? Are there signs of systemic problems, isolated incidents, or misaligned expectations?
4. Summarize each category in 3 to 6 bullet points, highlighting key sentiments (positive and negative), representative concerns or compliments, and any significant outliers

Present your findings in a clean, professional way with one section per category. 

This is the employee feedback data: {survey_results}

# 2. Class for structured output

    "Summary of the different categorizes recognized in the feedback from an IT-survey."

        description="For each category: Category name and 3-6 bullet points summarizing the category."

# 4: Call the model with the dataset from the survey
